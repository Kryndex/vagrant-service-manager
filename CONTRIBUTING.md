# Contributing to vagrant-service-manager Plugin

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the
`vagrant-service-manager` plugin, which is hosted in the [`Project Atomic
Organization`](https://github.com/projectatomic) on GitHub.

These are just guidelines, please use your best judgement and feel free
to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

At this point, this document is not complete, but as decisions are made on the
[`container-tools@redhat.com`](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/container-tools)
mailing list they will be added to this document.

## Pull Requests

* All changes will be made by pull request (PR), even from core
  committers/maintainers.

* All changes must include appropriate documentation updates.

* All changes must include an entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` in the
  *unreleased* section describing the change.  Your new entry should be
  the first entry after *unreleased.*

* All changes need at least 2 ACKs from maintainers before they will be merged. If
  the author of the PR is a maintainer, their submission is considered
  to be the first ACK.  Therefore, PRs from maintainers only need one
  additional ACK.

  By "2 ACKs" we mean that two maintainers must acknowledge that the change
  is a good one. The 2<sup>nd</sup> person to ACK the PR should merge the PR with
  a comment including their agreement.
